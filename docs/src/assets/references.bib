  abstract = {DataFrames.jl is a package written for and in the Julia language offering flexible and efficient handling of tabular data sets in memory. Thanks to Julia’s unique strengths, it provides an appealing set of features: Rich support for standard data processing tasks and excellent flexibility and efficiency for more advanced and non-standard operations. We present the fundamental design of the package and how it compares with implementations of data frames in other languages, its main features, performance, and possible extensions. We conclude with a practical illustration of typical data processing operations.},
